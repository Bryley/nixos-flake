# Insert your commit message above.
#
# Try to follow the following 7 rules detailed at:
# https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/
# 
# 1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
# 2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
# 3. Capitalize the subject line
# 4. Do not end the subject line with a period
# 5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
# 6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
# 7. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
#
# Note: Imperative mood means writing like giving a command, eg:
#         - "Fix repetative rendering bug"
#         - "Refactor database functions"
#         - "Update documentation for installation"
#       Ask yourself, does it follow the format:
#       "If applied, this commit will ..."

# Personal convention:
# 
# Prepend the commit with one of the following characters to describe
# type of commit:
#
# - `.` - for minor commits
# - `-` - for bug fixes
# - `*` - for major changes
# - `+` - for new features
# - `^` - for enhancements
# - `!` - for breaking changes
